# 👋 Hey, I’m bxnkar

Computer Engineering student | Backend • DSA • Machine Learning  
I build things. I break them. I figure out why. Then I build them better.

## 🧠 About Me

I like working on problems that make me think instead of just following steps.  
Most of my time goes into backend development, data structures, and machine learning.

Languages and tools I work with:
- Python, Java, C++
- Flask, Django, NestJS, Next.js
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- Git, GitHub, Cloud platforms

This GitHub is a snapshot of what I’m learning and building.  
Always in progress. Always upgrading.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Strengthening core DSA concepts  
- Building backend-heavy projects
